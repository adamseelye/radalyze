RADALYZE built by Adam Seelye as Project 0 for training at Revature

Radalyze is a Python app that reads historical Gamma Radiation detector data from
detectors based in different sites around the U.S.A. and displays the data in a graph
format, all in a command line interface.

To start using the app, simply download the source. Make sure Python 3 is installed
and then run RADALYZE with the command "python3 radalyze.py" from the radalyze directory.

Thanks for checking it out!
